# Covid Frontend by Marcelina

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0.

## Setup environment 
Angular requires Node.js in your system (version 8.x or 10.x). If you already have it, you can skip this part.

Install Angular CLI from `http://cli.angular.io `  or by command `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
